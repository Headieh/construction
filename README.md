# Construction

This site was built to be a fun placeholder while my next project is being worked on.

This project demonstrates:
-   jQuery
-   Use of dynamic data from an API
-   Custom styling, including web fonts
-   Animations
-   Gulp


### To Migrate Code:
-   Verify `node` is installed by running `node -v`
-   If `node` is not already installed: [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   Use `cd` to navigate to the folder you want this code to belong in within terminal
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `gulp`
-   If you have permissions issues, checkout this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50258901/cannot-find-module-gulp-sass)
